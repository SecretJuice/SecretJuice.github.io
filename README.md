# universal-cake
A simple clicker webgame made to introduce myself to JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Node.js

This was litterally the very first thing I ever did with JavaScript and Node.js. I've had some exposure to HTML and CSS, but only a bit. This was a very
cool refresher and introduction to these languages and frameworks.

TODO:
- Save user data (not sure how yet, maybe cookies?) (DONE üëç)
- Create a real pricing formula rather than simply going up a power each button.

That ought to be it. After this, I want to transfer what I've learned to a more substantial resume piece.
